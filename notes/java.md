# Recommendations for solving lab 2 with Java

The stub for lab 2 uses Java 21,
which admits a more readable alternative to the visitor pattern suggested in the book.
The following example code shows how you can process an object ```exp``` of the type type ```Exp```
generated by the parser defined in the stub.

```java
switch(exp) {
    case EInt    e -> ... ;
    case EDouble e -> ... ;
    case EAnd    e -> ... ;
    case EOr    e -> ... ;
    ...
    default -> throw new IllegalStateException("Case for " + e + " is not yet implemented.");
}
```

On the right hand side of the ```->``` you can extract further information from ```e```,
for example, in the case ```EAnd e```, you can use the two operands ```e.exp_1``` and ```e.exp_2```.

```switch```, if used like above produces a Java-expression, which means that you can use it in assignments:

```java
var typedExpression = switch(exp) { ... }
```

To define the neccessary datatypes, ```record```s are very useful.
You can define a record like this:

```java
public record TypedAnd(TypedExpr e1, TypedExpr e2) {
}
```

Objects of this type can be constructed with ```new TypedAnd(e1,e2)``` where ```e1``` and ```e2``` are ```TypedExpr```s. For solving the lab, it is reasonable to define an ```interface``` ```TypedExpr``` with a method which returns the type of an expression:

```java
public interface TypedExpr {
  Type type();
}
```

Where ```Type``` is a datatype for types that needs to be defined. With this interface, the ```TypedAnd``` from above can be turned into an implementation like this:

```java
public record TypedAnd(TypedExpr e1, TypedExpr e2) {
  Type type() {
    return new Type.Bool; // this is what it could look like if you implement basic types as an enum
  }
}
```
