```
$ tar -zxf lab4-testsuite.tar.gz
```

+ Enter the ``lab4-testsuite`` directory:
```
$ cd lab4-testsuite
```

+ Compile the test program using ``make`` or alternatively:
```
$ ghc --make -o progs-test-lab4 progs-test-lab4.hs
```


= Running the testsuite =

This is what you need to do to test your interpreter.

+ Enter the ``lab4-testsuite`` directory (if you are not there already):
```
$ cd lab4-testsuite
```

+ Run ``progs-test-lab4`` with the path to the directory where your solution is located:

```
$ ./progs-test-lab4 path/to/your/solution/
```
