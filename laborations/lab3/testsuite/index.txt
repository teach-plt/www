= Introduction =

Before you submit lab 3, your solution must pass the
testsuite. This document describes how to obtain and use
this testsuite.

**NOTE:** After some time, we may chose to add more test
cases. We recommend that you use the latest
version of the test suite to check your solution before submission.
This helps you catch errors that you would otherwise have to wait
for the grader to spot.

If you encounter problems, send mail to the teachers or to the course
Google group.
