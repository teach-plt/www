=Summary=

The objective of this assignment is to write a code generator from a fragment C--
of the C/C++ programming language to JVM, the Java Virtual Machine.
The code generator should produce Java class files, which
can be run in the Java bytecode interpreter so that they
correctly perform all their input and output actions.

The code generator is partially characterized by compilation schemes in
Chapter 6 of the PLT book. More JVM instructions are given in Appendix B of the book.
These explanations follow Jasmin assembler; the code generator may
emit Jasmin assembly code into text files, which are then processed
further by [Jasmin #jasmin-tips] to create class files.

The recommended implementation is via a BNF
grammar processed by the BNF Converter (BNFC) tool. The syntax
tree created by the parser is first type checked by using the
type checker created in [Lab 2 ../lab2/index.html].
The code generator should then make a pass over the type-annotated
syntax produced by the type checker.

The approximate size of the grammar is 50 rules, and the code generator
should be around 300-700 lines, depending on the programming language
used.
All BNFC supported languages can be used, but guidance is guaranteed
only for Haskell and Java.

Before the work can be submitted, the program has to pass
the [test suite ./testsuite/index.html].


=Method=

The recommended procedure for the compiler is two passes:

+ build a symbol table that for every function gives its type in a form
  usable for JVM code generation;
+ compile the program by generating a class file containing every
  source code function as a method.


You can start by copying your ``CMM.cf`` grammar and the
``TypeChecker`` module from [Lab 2 ../lab2/index.html] to the same directory.
Make sure that the type-annotated syntax indicates where a conversion
from int to double occurs, such that the conversion instruction ``i2d``
can be placed by the code generator.

% Then, modify the type checker to produce type-annotated abstract syntax,
% such that the correct instruction (for ``int`` or ``double``)
% can be picked by the code generator.
% The type-annotated syntax should also make clear where a conversion
% from int to double occurs, such that the conversion instruction ``i2d``
% can be placed by the code generator.




=Language specification=

The language is the same as in [Lab 2 ../lab2/index.html], except the handling of uninitialized variables, and you can reuse the
parser and type checker.

Programs using uninitialized variables fall under undefined behavior
in this lab, meaning that any semantics for such programs is allowed.

There are four built-in functions:
```
  void   printInt(int x)        // print an integer and a newline in standard output
  void   printDouble(double x)  // print a double and a newline in standard output
  int    readInt()              // read an integer from standard input
  double readDouble()           // read a double from standard input
```
These functions can be defined in a separate **runtime** class, which
can be obtained e.g. from writing these functions in Java and
compiling to a class file.
**A ready-made Java file is**
[here testsuite/Runtime.java].

==Bytecode verification==

When running your compiled programs, the Java bytecode you have
generated will be automatically sanity-checked by a Java bytecode
verifier (which is part of the JVM you are using). The verifier will
e.g. check that there are no operand stack overflows or underflows and
that all local variable uses and stores are valid. If your code does
not pass the verifier, a ``java.lang.VerifyError`` exception will be
thrown (with an often useful error message).

==Class structure==

Boilerplate code, see the PLT book, Chapter 6, or the example below.

==Functions==

Methods in the class, ``main`` special, see Chapter 6, or example below.

Note that all returns must be explicit in Java bytecode, including
returns from functions returning ``void``. (The bytecode verifier will
complain if it thinks that a function may end without returning.)

For non-``void``-returning functions you are allowed to assume that returns are always properly placed by the programmer who wrote the input source code. However, for ``void``-returning functions you must consider the possibility that no explicit return statement was included in the program source code.

==Statements and expressions==

The semantics is the same as in [Lab 2 ../lab2/index.html] (again, except for programs using uninitialized variables). In other words,
running the generated classes in ``java`` produces the same behavior
as running the source code in the ``lab2`` interpreter.

==Example==

File [good03.cc good03.cc]
```
int main ()
{
  int arg = readInt() ;
  int ret = 1 ;

  int i = 1 ;

  while (i < arg + 1) {
    ret = i * ret ;
    ++i ;
  }

  printInt(ret) ;
  return 0 ;
}
```
could compile to [good03.j good03.j] as follows:
```
;; Boilerplate: a wrapping class for cc code

.class public good03
.super java/lang/Object

.method public <init>()V
  .limit locals 1
  .limit stack 1

  aload_0
  invokespecial java/lang/Object/<init>()V
  return

.end method

;; The java-style main method calls the cc main

.method public static main([Ljava/lang/String;)V
  .limit locals 1
  .limit stack 1

  invokestatic good03/main()I
  pop
  return

.end method

;; Program

.method public static main()I
  .limit locals 3
  .limit stack 3

  ;; int arg = readInt();

  invokestatic Runtime/readInt()I
  istore_0

  ;; int ret = 1;

  iconst_1
  istore_1

  ;; int i = 1;

  iconst_1
  istore_2

  ;; while (i < arg + 1)

  L0:            ;; // beginning of loop, check condition
  iload_2        ;; i
  iload_0
  iconst_1
  iadd           ;; arg + 1
  if_icmplt L2   ;; i < arg + 1 ?
  iconst_0
  goto L3
  L2:            ;; i < arg + 1 is true
  iconst_1
  L3:            ;; i < arg + 1 is false
  iconst_0
  if_icmpeq L1   ;; if last comparison was false, exit while loop

  ;; ret = i * ret

  iload_2
  iload_1
  imul
  istore_1
  iload_1
  pop

  ;; ++i

  iload_2
  iconst_1
  iadd
  istore_2  ;; // i = i + 1
  iload_2
  pop

  ;; // continue loop
  goto L0

  ;; printInt(ret)

  L1:
  iload_1
  invokestatic Runtime/printInt(I)V
  nop

  ;; return 0

  iconst_0
  ireturn

.end method
```
(The comments are only for seeing the connection between .cc and .j).

A smarter compiler might generate the following better code
for the ``while`` loop:
```
	;; while (i < arg + 1)

	goto	L1
L0:

	;; ret = i * ret;

	iload_2
	iload_1
	imul
	istore_1

	;; ++ i;

	iinc	2 1
L1:
	iload_2
	iload_0
	iconst_1
	iadd
	if_icmplt	L0
```
This code has only 11 instructions instead of the 23 above.


=Solution format=


==Solution templates==[stubs]

For Haskell and Java there are stubs that can be extended to the full
solution.  You may download one of the following tar archives, unpack,
write the code, test, pack the archive again, and submit to fire.

- [Haskell package lab3-stub-haskell.tar.gz]
- [Java package lab3-stub-java.tar.gz]


These packages contain the grammar, stubs for type checker and
compiler, code to invoke Jasmin, [jasmin.jar haskell/jasmin.jar],
and suitable makefiles.
% (You probably want to adapt your type checker from [Lab 2 ../lab2/index.html],
% rather than starting from scratch.
% But have a look at these stubs anyway, they contain code to invoke Jasmin.)
The stubs match the requirements for the solution format as
detailed in the following:


==Input and output==

The code generator must be a program called ``lab3``, which is
executed by the command
```
  lab3 <SourceFile>
```
and produces a class (``.class``) file.
It may do this by first generating Jasmin assembly code (a ``.j`` file) and then calling Jasmin on this code.
For help with building the Jasmin file, refer to the [Jasmin instructions http://jasmin.sourceforge.net/instructions.html] and [Java bytecode instruction listings https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode_instruction_listings].
Jasmin can be called by
```
  java -jar jasmin.jar <File>.j
```
or
```
  jasmin <File>.j
```
if you have installed Jasmin as a stand-alone program.

The generated class file should have the same name and be **in the same directory** as the original source file:
```
  lab3 ../a/b/c.cc
```
This should produce a class file ``../a/b/c.class``.
To instruct Jasmin to place the file ``c.class`` in the correct directory,
use Jasmin's  option ``-d``, for instance, ``jasmin -d ../a/b ../a/b/c.j``.
(Note: to //run// a class file in a subdirectory, that directory needs
to be in the ``CLASSPATH``, e.g., ``java -cp ../a/b:path/to/runtime c``
can be used to run ``../a/b/c.class`` without changing to its
directory, assuming that ``Runtime.class`` is located in
``path/to/runtime``.)


The output at failure is a code generator error, or
``TYPE ERROR`` or ``SYNTAX ERROR`` as in Assignment 2.

The input can be read not only from user typing on the
terminal, but also from standard input redirected from
a file or by ``echo``. For instance,
```
  echo 20 | java good03
  java good03 <<< 20
  java good03 < input.txt
```
(where ``input.txt`` might contain ``20``).




==Example of success==

Source file:
```
// file good.cc
int main ()
{
  int i = readInt() ; // e.g. 5

  printInt(i) ;       // e.g. 5
  printInt(i++) ;     // e.g. 5
  printInt(i) ;       // e.g. 6
  printInt(++i) ;     // e.g. 7
  printInt(i) ;       // e.g. 7

  return 0 ;
}
```
Running the compiler:
```
$ tree
.
├── Runtime.class
└── test
    └── good.cc

$ lab3 test/good.cc

$ tree
.
├── Runtime.class
└── test
    ├── good.cc
    └── good.class


$ echo 5 | java -cp test:. good
5
5
6
7
7
```




==Compiling the code generator==

The compiler is submitted as source files that can be compiled by typing ``make``.



=Test programs=

% //If you have any problems getting the test program to run, or if
% you think that there is an error in the test suite, contact the
% teachers of the course via the mailing list.//

We also provide a [test suite ./testsuite/index.html] for Lab 3 (with
the same test cases as for [Lab 2 ../lab2/index.html]). Passing all
these tests is **required** for passing this lab.

**Run your compiler and the generated code with the test suite before submitting the assignment.**

Download the entire [test suite folder ./testsuite/index.html] or the [tarball ./testsuite/lab3-testsuite.tar.gz] and compile it using ``make``.
The test script can then be run as follows:
```
  ./progs-test-lab3 ../path/to/solution/
```

==Jasmin tips==[jasmin-tips]

Jasmin is available on [Sourceforge http://jasmin.sourceforge.net/].
Note that version 2.4 is included in the
[stubs #stubs]
%[Haskell stub lab3-stub-haskell.tar.gz] and
%[Java stub lab3-stub-java.tar.gz]
and that there are also versions on
e.g. Ubuntu (``apt install jasmin-sable``)
and macOS (``brew install jasmin``).

% ; however, the testsuite you have to pass expects you to invoke Jasmin via `java -jar jasmin.jar`.

Make sure your class names in Jasmin have simple names without slashes or dots.
If the first line of your Jasmin file is
```
.class public x/y/z.cc
```
then Jasmin will compile it to a file
```
x/y/z/cc.class
```
regardless of what the name of the ``.j`` file is.
The easiest option, and also what the test suite expects,
is that your class name is just a string
without any slashes or dots (in this example, just "z").

Also note that it seems that each statement in your Jasmin file needs
to be **terminated** by a newline, in particular the last
``.end method`` directive.

**Important:**
Make sure that your compiler waits for the Jasmin conversion to finish before exiting.
In other words, it shouldn't exit before the ``.class`` file has been written.
For example when using Haskell, you can do the following:
```
p <- runCommand <call jasmin here>
waitForProcess p
```
or with at least version 1.2.0.0 (December 2013) of library [process https://hackage.haskell.org/package/process] installed, simply:
```
callCommand <call jasmin here>
```


=Success criteria=

Your program must be compatible with the [test suite ./testsuite/index.html] and meet the
specification in this document in all respects.

The code you generate must pass the Java bytecode verification.
Note: Passing the verifier check means
no additional work beyond generating correct code (such as not popping
empty stacks etc.).

The solution must be written in an easily readable and maintainable way. In
particular, tailoring it for the programs in the test suite is not maintainable!
