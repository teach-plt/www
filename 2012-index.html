<H1>Description</H1>

<P>
The aim of the course is to give understanding of how programming
languages are designed, documented, and implemented. The course covers
the basic techniques and tools needed to write interpreters, and
gives a summary introduction to compilation as well.  Those who have
passed the course should be able to
</P>

<OL>
<LI>define the lexical structure of programming languages by using
  regular expressions, explain the functioning of finite automata,
  and implement lexical analysers by using standard tools;
<LI>define the syntax of programming languages by using context-free
  grammars, explain the principles of LL and LR parsing, and implement
  parsers by using standard tools;
<LI>define and implement abstract syntax;
<LI>master the technique of syntax-directed translation and its
  efficient implementation in their chosen programming language;
<LI>formulate typing rules and implement type checkers;
<LI>formulate operational semantic rules and implement interpreters;
<LI>write simple code generators;
<LI>be familiar with the basic implementation issues of both
  imperative and functional languages;
<LI>design and implement special-purpose programming languages.
<LI>master the principles of polymorphic type checking by unification
<LI>implement an interpreter for a functional language
</OL>

<H1>Teachers</H1>

<P>

The fastest way to get an answer is to mail the course's
Google group <A HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/proglang-course-2012">http://groups.google.com/group/proglang-course-2012</A>.
</P>

<H1>Google Group</H1>

<P>
If you have any general questions regarding the course, the labs or the exercises, 
please ask them in our
Google group <A HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/proglang-course-2012">http://groups.google.com/group/proglang-course-2012</A>.
This will reach all teachers and fellow students. 
If you are not yet member of the group, you have to
</P>

<UL>
<LI>get a google account, and
<LI>request an invitation to the proglang-course-2012 group.
</UL>

<P>
You can do both on <A HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/proglang-course-2012">the group page</A>.
<B>You will have to give your real name and your person number when you register,</B>
<B>otherwise your membership is not approved.</B>
This is necessary to identify you as a participant of the course.
</P>

<H1>Laboration times and supervision</H1>

<P>
Location: ED 3507
</P>
<P>
Times:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Monday 10-12 (Arnar)
<LI>Monday 15-17 (Grégoire)
</UL>

<P>
<B>Notice</B>: Wednesday 10-12 classes cancelled from 8 February.
</P>
<P>
Extra supervisor at some of the times, especially before lab deadlines.
The labs rooms and supervision
are available from the second week of the course (Monday 23 January).
</P>
<P>
Normally, each student should attend one supervised laboration time each week.
Since attendance is not compulsory, there may be room for more 
times. But, if there is lack of room, those who attend their first 
supervision of the week have priority to get a place and supervisor help.
</P>

<H1>Literature</H1>

<P>
Aho, Lam, Sethi &amp; Ullman:
<I>Compilers Principles, Techniques &amp; Tools</I>
<B>Second edition</B>,
Pearson/Addison Wesley
2007 
</P>
<P>
also known as <I>the Dragon book</I>.
</P>
<P>
Make sure to get the second edition! The book is available
at web bookshops and will be sold at Cremona.
</P>
<P>
The lecture notes are also being developed
in the form of a book. They will cover the material needed for the
course, whereas the Dragon book contains much more and will also serve
the Compiler Construction course.
<B>The book appeared soon after the course</B>: see
<A HREF="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/course/DAT151/">PLT book</A>)
</P>
<P>
More on functional languages, and some help for Lab 3, is given in these
<A HREF="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/talks/compilation-agay.pdf">slides</A>
by Xavier Leroy.
</P>

<H1>Laborations</H1>

<P>
There will be three laborations, written individually or in
pairs. 
</P>

<UL>
<LI>deadline 3/2:  <A HREF="laborations/lab1/lab1.html">parser</A>
<LI>deadline 20/2: <A HREF="laborations/lab2/lab2.html">type checker and interpreter</A>
<LI>deadline 5/3: <A HREF="laborations/lab4/lab3.html">functional language</A>
</UL>

<P>
Reporting is done via
<A HREF="https://fire.cs.chalmers.se:8009/cgi/Fire-proglang">Fire</A>.
Before reporting, you must run your program through a test suite,
such as the one for <A HREF="laborations/lab1/testscript/">lab 1</A>.
</P>
<P>
<B>Final deadline is Wednesday 15 March</B> for all returned and corrected labs.
No labs will be graded after this deadline.
</P>

<H1>Exercises</H1>

<P>
There are two classes on Wednesday at 15-17:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>in ML3 (Arnar)
<LI>in ML4 (Ramona)
</UL>

<P>
Exercises give <B>bonus points</B> for the exam: 0.4 points per exercise, the sum
rounded to the nearest integer. To claim bonus points, mark the ones you have
done in a list in the beginning of the class. Marking an exercise means that you
are prepared to present its solution on the blackboard.
</P>
<P>
To make sure that all your bonus points are counted, you should always go to the 
same teacher's class.
</P>

<H1>Exam</H1>

<P>
Written exam, usual grading scales.
Extra points will be given for exercises.
